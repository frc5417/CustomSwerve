# CustomSwerve

[![CI](https://github.com/frc5417/CustomSwerve/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/frc5417/CustomSwerve/actions/workflows/main.yml)

_Swerve is something that should be inclusive to every team, whether they're a shining veteran or a soaring rookie. So, we programmers from team 5417, Eagle Robotics, developed this algorithm and made it open-source so that any team can swerve around the field. (The documentation is currently in progress)._
